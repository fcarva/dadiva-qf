## Quadratic funding calculator

### What is?

Dadiva is an educational tool about quadratic funding

Quadratic funding is a coordinating mechanism to finance public goods, in this financing mechanism the amount of contribution matters more than the amount donated.

There is a project of a QF calculator, created by the site (wtfisqf.com)
 
My intention is to create a storytelling for the process of creating the project, description, funding round (simulation), the result of the donation with the QF. 

Each step can include a tutorial on how it works and some information for the user to interact

### What's the goal?

The goal is to pass the QF on in a simple and interactive way, in which the person at the end of the experience can understand how a round works, how the QF math works, encourage people to create their projects, 

I would like to add an educational layer to the calculator on the (wtfisqf.com)

On the website you add the amount of the Project, how many people donate and the amount donated. the result is given by the formula. I would like to add a storytelling, exactly to solve this doubt of what QF will be used for
